# Lego Mindstorms Small Basic programs

Sample programs for the Lego Mindstorms brick written in Small Basic

## Why?

As an engineer, I find the Lego Labview visual programming environment frustrating. There are many good reasons why professional engineers don't use visual programming environments.

Yet I didn't want to write over my Lego brick firmware with some other environment. Lego had already killed/bricked my out of warranty NXT with an official update, so I didn't want to chance it with something unofficial. Fortunately, there is a Small Basic programming environment (https://sites.google.com/site/ev3basic/small-basic-ev3) that can be used without making any modifications to your EV3 brick.

This repo will include all of the programs I make as I learn to use the Lego EV3 Mindstorms system.

## What will you include?

These programs will start simple and increase in complexity as I learn.
