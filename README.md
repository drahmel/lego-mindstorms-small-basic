## Why?

As an engineer, I find the Lego Labview visual programming environment frustrating. There are many good reasons why professional engineers don't use visual programming environments.

Looking for alternatives, I didn't want to write over my Lego brick firmware with some other environment. Lego had already killed/bricked my out-of-warranty NXT with an official update, so I didn't want to chance killing my EV3 with something unofficial.

Fortunately, there is a Small Basic programming environment (https://sites.google.com/site/ev3basic/small-basic-ev3) that can be used without making any modifications to your EV3 brick. You just install Small Basic, install the EV3 module, and it will download and run on your stock EV3 through the USB cable or Bluetooth -- same as if you programmed with the visual environment.

This repo will include all of the programs I make as I learn to use the Lego EV3 Mindstorms system.

## What will you include?

These programs will start simple and increase in complexity as I learn.
